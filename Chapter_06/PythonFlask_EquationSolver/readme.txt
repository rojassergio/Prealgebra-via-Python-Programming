To run this program you need Flask installed in your Python
(Anaconda distribution has it already installed)

To run the program, in a system shell (terminal)  execute the instruction:
   python EquationSolver.py

It should show something like:
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    * Restarting with stat
    * Debugger is active!
    * Debugger PIN: 337-019-416

Then open a web browser and point it to the web address
shown in the line that says "Running on", which in this case is
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Alternatively, after executing the previous python instruction, in a 
different system shell (terminal) you could execute:
    firefox http://127.0.0.1:5000/

To use he program, please read the appendix of chapter 6 of the book,
